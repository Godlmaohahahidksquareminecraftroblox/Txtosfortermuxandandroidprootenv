# Txtosfortermuxandandroidprootenv

A lightweight virtual filesystem and environment for Termux that mimics a minimal Linux userland entirely in Python. Designed to help you experiment and play with process management, built-in commands, file manipulation, and more — all inside a virtual proot-style filesystem.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Python-based virtual filesystem** (`os.py`)
- Implements standard commands like `ls`, `cd`, `mv`, `cat`, `grep`, `chmod`, `ps`, `kill`, etc.
- Provides a persistent filesystem using `vfs_save.zip`
- Includes helper scripts (`helpers/importf` and `helpers/run`)
- Requires **no root** — can be run entirely inside Termux
- Lightweight and sandboxed

---

## 🧠 Core `os.py`

This file (`os.py`) is the heart of the project. It:
- Creates a `proc` and `dev` directory under a temporary folder (`/tmp`)
- Sets up built-in shell commands that can manipulate the VFS
- Supports simple multitasking (`ps`, `kill`)
- Runs ELF binaries inside the virtual filesystem

---

## 🛠️ Helpers

There are two helper scripts located in `helpers/`:
  
### `importf`
Copy a file **from the real Termux filesystem into the virtual filesystem**.

Usage:
```
helpers/importf /absolute/path/in/termux /path/in/vfs
```
Example:
```
helpers/importf /data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/bash /bin/bash
```

---

```run

Run an ELF binary from the virtual filesystem inside the virtual environment.

Usage:
```
helpers/run /bin/bash
```

---

🧪 Getting Started

1. Clone this repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/Godlmaohahahidksquareminecraftroblox/Txtosfortermuxandandroidprootenv.git
cd Txtosfortermuxandandroidprootenv
```

2. Make the helper scripts executable and accessible:
```
cp helpers/importf helpers/run $PREFIX/bin/
chmod +x $PREFIX/bin/importf $PREFIX/bin/run
```

3. Run the virtual shell:
```
python3 os.py
```



---

⚡ Usage Tips

Use importf to copy binaries you need into the virtual filesystem.

Run them using ```run```(yes thats a literal command).

Files and processes created will persist across sessions thanks to the zip archiving.

Press CTRL+C to return to the virtual shell prompt.

📱 setup_android_proot — Android Proot Environment

This repository also contains a fully-automated setup script (setup_android_proot/*.py) for creating a real proot-style environment on Android with Termux.

✅ Features:

Sets up a proper proot environment with /bin, /lib, /etc inside a sandbox.

Fetches and copies core binaries (sh, linker64, etc.) from the Android system into the virtual environment.

Scans and copies necessary system libraries (libc.so, libm.so, liblog.so, etc.), including those from /apex.

Installs BusyBox or Toybox applets into the environment so most common shell commands work.

Generates a ready-to-run startup.sh file so you can proot -0 -r <env> and jump into a minimal Linux-like filesystem on Android.



---

💻 Usage

1. Make sure you have proot, strace, and wget installed:

pkg install proot strace wget


2. Run the setup:

cd setup_android_proot
bash setup.py   # Or setup_offline.py if you already have busybox binaries


3. A file named startup.sh will be created in the repo directory. Run it:

bash startup.sh


4. 🎉 You’ll drop into a proot jail with a working /bin and /lib!




---

🤷 Why include this?
While os.py is a Python-based virtual filesystem simulator, setup_android_proot sets up a real proot container using actual system binaries.
Both tools share the goal of exploring file operations, commands, and sandboxing in a Termux environment — just at different levels.
